Debugging TypeScript with Browser Dev Tools
Objective: To familiarize students with debugging TypeScript applications using browser developer tools.

Task: In this assignment, you will share a TypeScript application with a known bug or issue. Students are required to use browser developer tools to inspect and debug the code to identify the problem. They should provide a step-by-step debugging process, including screenshots or descriptions of their findings. Additionally, students should submit the corrected TypeScript code with the issue fixed.

Instructions:

Part 1: Debugging Scenario

Scenario:

You are given a TypeScript application that contains a known bug or issue that is affecting its functionality. Your task is to debug the application using browser developer tools to identify and fix the problem.

Your Task:

Familiarize yourself with the provided TypeScript application, including its functionality and any apparent issues or bugs.

Part 2: Debugging with Browser Developer Tools

Use browser developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools, Firefox DevTools) to debug the TypeScript application.

Launch the application in a web browser.

Open the browser developer tools and navigate to the "Console" and "Sources" tabs or equivalent options.

Inspect and debug the code to identify the cause of the issue. Use breakpoints, console logs, and other debugging features as needed.

Provide a detailed step-by-step debugging process:

Describe the steps you took to identify the problem, including any specific actions you performed in the developer tools.

Include screenshots or descriptions of the code snippets you examined during debugging.

Explain how you determined the root cause of the issue.

Part 3: Correct the Issue

Once you have identified the problem, fix the bug or issue within the TypeScript code.

Ensure that your corrections are logically sound and address the root cause of the problem.
Part 4: Submission

Submit the following:

a. A detailed report of your debugging process, including step-by-step instructions and any screenshots or descriptions of code snippets you examined during debugging.

b. The corrected TypeScript code with the issue fixed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correct identification of the bug or issue within the TypeScript application.

Effective use of browser developer tools for debugging, including the use of breakpoints, console logs, and code inspection.

Clarity and completeness of the debugging process report, including step-by-step instructions and descriptions of debugging actions.

Proper correction of the issue within the TypeScript code, ensuring that the root cause of the problem is addressed.

Overall correctness and completeness of the assignment.
