Setting Up a TypeScript Environment
Objective: To set up a TypeScript development environment and configure the TypeScript compiler.

Task: In this assignment, you will learn how to set up a TypeScript development environment from scratch. Your task is to follow step-by-step instructions to install Node.js, TypeScript, and a code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code). You will then create a simple TypeScript file, compile it to JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler, and provide a screenshot of your code editor showing the compiled JavaScript.

Instructions:

Part 1: Environment Setup

Install Node.js:

a. Visit the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/).

b. Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version suitable for your operating system (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).

c. Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.

d. Verify the installation by opening a terminal (command prompt or terminal emulator) and running the following commands:

bash
Copy code
node -v
npm -v
These commands should display the installed Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) versions.

Install a Code Editor:

a. Download and install a code editor of your choice. We recommend Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as it has excellent TypeScript support.

b. Visit the Visual Studio Code website (https://code.visualstudio.com/).

c. Download the installer for your operating system and follow the installation instructions.

Install TypeScript:

a. Open your code editor (e.g., VS Code).

b. Open the integrated terminal within your code editor.

c. Run the following command to install TypeScript globally:

bash
Copy code
npm install -g typescript
d. Verify the installation by running:

bash
Copy code
tsc -v
This command should display the installed TypeScript version.

Part 2: Creating and Compiling a TypeScript File

Create a TypeScript File:

a. Create a new folder for your TypeScript project (e.g., typescript-project).

b. Inside the project folder, create a new TypeScript file named main.ts.

Write TypeScript Code:

a. Open main.ts in your code editor.

b. Write a simple TypeScript code snippet, for example:

typescript
Copy code
function greet(name: string) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

const message = greet("TypeScript Developer");
console.log(message);
Compile TypeScript to JavaScript:

a. In the integrated terminal, navigate to your project folder (e.g., cd typescript-project).

b. Run the TypeScript compiler to transpile your TypeScript code into JavaScript:

bash
Copy code
tsc main.ts
c. This will generate a main.js file in the same folder.

Part 3: Submission

Take a Screenshot:

a. Open your code editor and display both the TypeScript main.ts file and the compiled JavaScript main.js file side by side.

b. Take a screenshot of your code editor with both files visible.

Submit Your Assignment:

a. Save the screenshot as a file (e.g., typescript_environment.png).

b. Zip the screenshot file along with any additional files if needed.

c. Submit the zip file through the course assignment submission portal.

Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Successful setup of a TypeScript development environment with Node.js, TypeScript, and a code editor.

Proper compilation of the TypeScript code to JavaScript.

Accuracy of the provided screenshot, which should show both the TypeScript and compiled JavaScript files in your code editor.

Adherence to the assignment instructions and completion of all required steps.
