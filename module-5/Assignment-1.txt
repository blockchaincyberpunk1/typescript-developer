API Integration with Promises
Objective: To practice working with APIs and handling asynchronous operations using Promises in TypeScript.

Task: In this assignment, you will be provided with the documentation of a RESTful API, such as a weather API. Your task is to create a TypeScript application that fetches data from this API. You should use Promises for asynchronous operations to handle the API requests and responses. The application should display the retrieved data in a user-friendly format. After implementing the application, you should submit the TypeScript code.

Instructions:

Part 1: API Documentation

Scenario:

You are tasked with creating a TypeScript application that fetches data from a RESTful API, such as a weather API. You will need to read the API documentation to understand how to make requests and handle responses.

Your Task:

Choose a RESTful API (e.g., weather, currency exchange, news, etc.) and read its documentation to understand the available endpoints and request/response formats.

Part 2: TypeScript Application

Create a TypeScript application that fetches data from the chosen API using the fetch API or any HTTP request library of your choice. You should use Promises to handle asynchronous operations.

Implement error handling for cases where the API request fails or returns an error response.

Parse the API response data and display it in a user-friendly format. For example, if you are using a weather API, you can display the weather forecast for a specific location.

Part 3: User Interface (Optional)

If you wish to enhance your assignment, create a simple user interface using HTML and CSS to interact with the API. For example, you can create a web page with a form to input parameters for the API request and display the results on the page.
Part 4: Submission

Submit the TypeScript code for your application. Include comments to explain how the code works, how you handle Promises, and how you handle errors.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correct implementation of the TypeScript application to fetch data from the chosen API using Promises.

Proper error handling for API requests and responses.

Parsing and displaying the retrieved data in a user-friendly format.

Clarity and completeness of comments explaining the code and how Promises are used.

Optional user interface (if implemented) that provides a user-friendly way to interact with the API.

Proper organization and structure of TypeScript code.

Overall correctness and completeness of the assignment.
