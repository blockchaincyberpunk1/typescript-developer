Complex API Integration and Data Processing
Objective: To simulate a real-world project involving complex API integration and data processing in TypeScript.

Task: In this assignment, you will challenge students to work on a complex API scenario, such as integrating with a social media API that requires authentication and supports pagination. Their task is to build a TypeScript application that can handle the intricacies of this API, including authentication, pagination, and efficient data processing. Students should create a user-friendly interface for displaying the data. After implementing the application, they should submit the TypeScript code, showcasing their ability to work with complex APIs and data.

Instructions:

Part 1: Complex API Scenario

Scenario:

You are tasked with building a TypeScript application that integrates with a complex API, such as a social media API. This API requires authentication, supports pagination for retrieving large datasets, and may have specific rate limiting and data processing requirements.

Your Task:

Simulate the integration with a complex API by defining the API's behavior and requirements. Consider the following aspects:

Authentication: Specify the authentication mechanism required to access the API (e.g., OAuth2, API keys, tokens).

Pagination: Define how the API handles pagination and how to retrieve multiple pages of data efficiently.

Rate Limiting: Describe any rate limiting policies imposed by the API and how to handle rate limits gracefully.

Data Processing: Specify the format of the API responses and any data processing or transformations required to display the data.

Part 2: TypeScript Application

Create a TypeScript application that integrates with the complex API defined in Part 1. Your application should:

Authenticate with the API using the specified authentication mechanism.

Implement pagination to retrieve and display multiple pages of data.

Handle rate limiting to ensure that API requests do not exceed rate limits.

Efficiently process and display the data retrieved from the API in a user-friendly interface.

Part 3: User Interface

Create a user-friendly interface for your TypeScript application. This can be a web page, a desktop application, or any appropriate interface for interacting with the API and displaying the data.

Implement user-friendly features that enhance the usability of the application (e.g., search, filtering, sorting).

Part 4: Documentation

Provide documentation for your TypeScript application, including:

An overview of the application's purpose and functionality.

Detailed instructions on how to set up and run the application.

Explanations of how the complex API integration works and how you handle authentication, pagination, and rate limiting.

Part 5: Submission

Submit the TypeScript code for your application, including any relevant configuration files (e.g., for authentication).
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correct implementation of the TypeScript application that integrates with the complex API.

Proper handling of authentication, pagination, and rate limiting as defined in the complex API scenario.

Efficient data processing and user-friendly display of the retrieved data.

Implementation of a user-friendly interface that enhances the usability of the application.

Clarity and completeness of documentation explaining the application's purpose, functionality, setup, and complex API integration.

Proper organization and structure of TypeScript code in the application.

Overall correctness and completeness of the assignment.
