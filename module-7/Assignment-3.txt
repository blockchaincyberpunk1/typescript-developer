Integrating TypeScript with a Front-End Framework (Angular, React, or Vue.js)
Objective: To showcase TypeScript's compatibility with popular front-end frameworks.

Task: In this assignment, you will allow students to choose one of the popular front-end frameworks, such as Angular, React, or Vue.js. Provide a starter template for their chosen framework and instruct them to build a simple application. For example, students can create a task management app with Angular, a user interface with React, or a real-time chat app with Vue.js, all using TypeScript. They should submit the TypeScript code, the framework-based project, and a brief report highlighting TypeScript's benefits in their chosen framework.

Instructions:

Part 1: Framework Selection

Scenario:

You are tasked with integrating TypeScript into a popular front-end framework to build a web application. You have the freedom to choose one of the following frameworks: Angular, React, or Vue.js.

Your Task:

Select one of the provided front-end frameworks (Angular, React, or Vue.js) that you are comfortable working with.

Part 2: Project Implementation

Use TypeScript to build a simple web application using your chosen front-end framework. The application should demonstrate the following:

Angular: Create a task management application where users can add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.

React: Build a user interface that allows users to search and filter a list of items (e.g., products, movies, or books).

Vue.js: Develop a real-time chat application where users can send and receive messages in a chat room.

Implement the core functionality of your chosen project using TypeScript:

Ensure that TypeScript is integrated seamlessly with the chosen framework.

Use TypeScript features, including type annotations, interfaces, and classes, to enhance the code quality.

Showcase TypeScript's benefits, such as static typing and code readability, within your project.

Part 3: Report

Create a brief report that highlights TypeScript's benefits in your chosen front-end framework:

Explain how TypeScript improved the development process and code quality in your project.

Discuss any challenges you faced while integrating TypeScript with the chosen framework and how you addressed them.

Part 4: Submission

Submit the following:

a. The TypeScript code containing your implementation of the web application using the chosen front-end framework.

b. The complete project of your web application, including all framework-specific files and configurations.

c. The report, which should be in a document format (e.g., PDF, Word), highlighting TypeScript's benefits and challenges in your project.

Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Successful integration of TypeScript with the chosen front-end framework.

Correct implementation of the web application's core functionality.

Effective use of TypeScript features, including type annotations, interfaces, and classes, to enhance code quality.

Clarity and completeness of the report, including explanations of TypeScript's benefits and any challenges faced during integration.

Proper organization and structure of the TypeScript code and the chosen framework's project.

Overall correctness and completeness of the assignment.
