TypeScript in Single Page Applications (SPAs)
Objective: To expose students to the development of single-page applications using TypeScript.

Task: In this assignment, you will assign students the development of a single-page application (SPA) with multiple views or sections. They can choose to build a blog platform, a dashboard for data visualization, or a multimedia portfolio, all using TypeScript. The project should incorporate routing, navigation, and dynamic content loading typical of SPAs. Students should submit the TypeScript code, HTML/CSS files, and a comprehensive report detailing their SPA's features, challenges faced, and lessons learned.

Instructions:

Part 1: Project Description

Scenario:

You are tasked with developing a single-page application (SPA) that showcases your proficiency in TypeScript and front-end development. The SPA should be user-friendly and incorporate features commonly found in SPAs.

Your Task:

Your task is to build a single-page application using TypeScript that serves a specific purpose or offers a set of features. You have the creative freedom to choose the type of application you want to create, but it should be a substantial project that demonstrates your skills.

Part 2: Project Implementation

Use TypeScript to implement the SPA:

Incorporate routing and navigation to enable users to move between different views or sections within your application.

Implement dynamic content loading, such as fetching and displaying data from an API, database, or local storage.

Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface with responsive design, ensuring the application works well on various devices.

If applicable, integrate external libraries or components to enhance your SPA.

Ensure that your TypeScript code is well-structured, modular, and follows best practices for front-end development.

Part 3: Report

Create a comprehensive report that provides insights into your SPA's development:

Describe the purpose and functionality of your SPA.

Explain how TypeScript was used in your project, including its role in routing, navigation, and dynamic content loading.

Discuss any challenges you encountered during development and how you addressed them.

Reflect on the lessons learned and the value of using TypeScript in building SPAs.

Part 4: Submission

Submit the following:

a. The TypeScript code containing your implementation of the SPA.

b. The complete project files, including HTML and CSS files, necessary for running the SPA.

c. The report, which should be in a document format (e.g., PDF, Word), detailing your SPA's features, challenges, and lessons learned.

Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Successful implementation of the SPA, including routing, navigation, dynamic content loading, and user interface design.

Effective use of TypeScript for developing SPAs, including proper organization, modularity, and code quality.

Clarity and completeness of the report, including explanations of the SPA's purpose, TypeScript's role, challenges faced, and lessons learned.

Proper organization and structure of the TypeScript code, HTML, and CSS files.

Overall correctness and completeness of the assignment.
