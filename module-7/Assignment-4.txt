Advanced Front-End Development with TypeScript
Objective: To challenge students with a more complex front-end development task using TypeScript.

Task: In this assignment, you will assign students a task that requires advanced front-end development skills. For instance, they can build a responsive e-commerce website with product listings, a shopping cart, and user authentication using TypeScript. Students should demonstrate their understanding of TypeScript's role in managing state, handling complex user interfaces, and integrating with back-end services if applicable. They should submit the TypeScript code, HTML/CSS files, and a detailed report describing their implementation and design decisions.

Instructions:

Part 1: Project Description

Scenario:

You are tasked with building an advanced front-end web application that showcases your skills in front-end development using TypeScript. The application should solve a real-world problem or offer a useful feature set.

Your Task:

Your task is to build an advanced front-end web application using TypeScript. You have the creative freedom to choose the type of application you want to create, but it should challenge your skills and knowledge in front-end development.

Part 2: Project Implementation

Use TypeScript to implement the chosen web application:

If your application requires state management, demonstrate how TypeScript is used to manage and update the application's state.

Implement complex user interfaces, including responsive design and interactive elements, using TypeScript.

If applicable, integrate your front-end application with back-end services or APIs. Ensure that TypeScript is used effectively for data communication and handling.

Focus on best practices for front-end development, including code organization, modularity, and maintainability.

Ensure that your TypeScript code is well-structured, readable, and follows best practices for front-end development.

Part 3: Report

Create a detailed report that describes your implementation and design decisions:

Explain the purpose and functionality of your web application.

Describe how TypeScript was used in your project, including its role in state management, user interface development, and integration with back-end services (if applicable).

Discuss any challenges you encountered during development and how you addressed them.

Part 4: Submission

Submit the following:

a. The TypeScript code containing your implementation of the advanced front-end web application.

b. The complete project files, including HTML and CSS files, necessary for running the application.

c. The report, which should be in a document format (e.g., PDF, Word), detailing your implementation and design decisions.

Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Successful implementation of the advanced front-end web application, including user interface design, responsiveness, and functionality.

Effective use of TypeScript for state management, complex user interface development, and integration with back-end services (if applicable).

Clarity and completeness of the report, including explanations of the application's purpose, TypeScript's role, and challenges faced during development.

Proper organization and structure of the TypeScript code, HTML, and CSS files.

Overall correctness and completeness of the assignment.
