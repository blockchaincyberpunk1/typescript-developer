Simple E-commerce Website with TypeScript
Objective: To apply TypeScript knowledge in the context of a simple e-commerce site.

Task: In this assignment, students will be tasked with building a basic e-commerce website that displays products, allows users to add items to a shopping cart, and proceed to checkout. They should use TypeScript to handle product data, cart functionality, and form validation. The assignment should include TypeScript code, HTML/CSS files, and a report detailing the implementation and any challenges faced.

Instructions:

Part 1: Project Description

Scenario:

You are tasked with creating a simple e-commerce website using TypeScript. The website should demonstrate your TypeScript skills and the ability to handle e-commerce functionality.

Your Task:

Your task is to build a basic e-commerce website that includes the following features:

Display a list of products with their names, prices, and images.
Allow users to add products to a shopping cart.
Display the shopping cart's contents, including product names, quantities, and total cost.
Implement a checkout form with validation for shipping information (e.g., name, address, payment details).
Calculate and display the final order total.
Part 2: Project Implementation

Use TypeScript to implement the e-commerce website:

Create a user-friendly and responsive user interface using HTML and CSS.

Implement TypeScript code to manage product data, shopping cart functionality, and form validation.

Ensure that the shopping cart data is maintained even when the page is refreshed (you can use local storage).

Implement form validation for the checkout process, ensuring that users provide valid shipping information.

Ensure that the application follows best practices for front-end development, including code organization, modularity, and maintainability.

Ensure that your TypeScript code is well-structured, readable, and follows best practices for front-end development.

Part 3: Report

Create a report that describes the implementation of your e-commerce website:

Explain the purpose and functionality of your website.

Describe how TypeScript was used in your project, including its role in handling product data, cart functionality, and form validation.

Discuss any challenges you encountered during development and how you addressed them.

Part 4: Submission

Submit the following:

a. The TypeScript code containing your implementation of the e-commerce website.

b. The complete project files, including HTML and CSS files, necessary for running the website.

c. The report, which should be in a document format (e.g., PDF, Word), detailing your website's features, challenges, and lessons learned.

Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Successful implementation of the e-commerce website, including product display, shopping cart functionality, form validation, and a user-friendly interface.

Effective use of TypeScript for front-end development, including proper organization, modularity, and code quality.

Clarity and completeness of the report, including explanations of the website's purpose, TypeScript's role, challenges faced, and lessons learned.

Proper organization and structure of the TypeScript code, HTML, and CSS files.

Overall correctness and completeness of the assignment.
