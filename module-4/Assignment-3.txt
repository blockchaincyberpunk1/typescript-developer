Organizing Code with Modules
Objective: To practice organizing code using modules and namespaces in TypeScript.

Task: In this assignment, you will be provided with a JavaScript project that lacks proper organization. Your task is to convert this project into a TypeScript project, organizing the code into modules. You should also use the import/export syntax to manage dependencies between modules. After organizing the code into modules, you should submit the TypeScript project with clear module organization and comments explaining your choices.

Instructions:

Part 1: JavaScript Project

Scenario:

You are given a JavaScript project that consists of multiple files. The project contains functions, classes, and variables scattered across different files without proper organization.

Your Task:

Convert the given JavaScript project into a TypeScript project with a clear module structure. You should create TypeScript modules to organize the code logically.

Part 2: TypeScript Implementation

Organize the JavaScript code into TypeScript modules based on logical groupings. For example, you can create modules for:

Functions related to user authentication.
Classes for managing data storage.
Utility functions for date formatting.
Any other logical groupings based on the provided code.
Use the export keyword to export functions, classes, or variables that need to be accessible from other modules.

Part 3: Dependency Management

Use the import statement to manage dependencies between modules. Ensure that modules correctly import the functions, classes, or variables they need.

Make sure that you properly specify the module paths in the import statements to reference the modules you have created.

Part 4: Comments and Documentation

Add comments to the TypeScript code to explain the purpose of each module, class, function, or variable.

Provide comments that explain your choices for organizing the code into modules and the reasons behind the import/export decisions you made.

Part 5: Test Cases

Create a TypeScript file named testApp.ts that demonstrates the usage of the modules you have created. Import and use functions or classes from your modules in this test file.

Include comments in testApp.ts to explain how the modules are used and demonstrate the functionality of your organized TypeScript project.

Part 6: Submission

Submit the entire TypeScript project, including all module files, with a clear module organization and comments explaining your choices.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correct organization of the JavaScript project into TypeScript modules.

Proper use of the export and import syntax to manage dependencies between modules.

Clarity and completeness of comments explaining the purpose of each module and the import/export choices.

Accuracy and completeness of test cases in testApp.ts that demonstrate the functionality of the organized TypeScript project.

Proper organization and structure of TypeScript code.

Overall correctness and completeness of the assignment.
